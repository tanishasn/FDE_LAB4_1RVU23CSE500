Healthcare Data Pipeline and Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for healthcare data processing, from ingestion to aggregation and visualization through a dashboard. It is structured into three main tasks:

📁 Project Structure
Task 1 - Data Ingestion

File: Task-1_Healthcare_Orders_Data Ingestion.ipynb
Description:
This notebook handles the ingestion of healthcare orders data from various sources. It focuses on extracting, cleaning, and storing raw data into a structured format, ensuring it is ready for further analysis.
Task 2 - Data Aggregation

File: Task-2_Data Aggregation_Healthcare.ipynb
Description:
This notebook performs aggregation and preprocessing on the ingested healthcare data. It implements transformations, data cleaning, and creates summary tables to provide a structured dataset for reporting and visualization.
Task 3 - Data Visualization Dashboard

File: Task-3_Healthcare_Dashboard.ipynb
Description:
This notebook provides an interactive dashboard to visualize key healthcare metrics. It helps stakeholders monitor order statistics, trends, and other aggregated insights through interactive plots and tables.
